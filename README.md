SignSpeak is an innovative application that bridges the communication gap between the deaf community and hearing individuals by translating American Sign Language (ASL) to text in real-time. Using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system captures hand gestures through a webcam and instantly converts them into corresponding text, making communication more accessible and efficient.
